\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

As the climate warms and humans continue to emit greenhouse gasses into
the atmosphere, the sea-level will continue to rise at alarming rates.
According to the European Environment Agency, the global sea level has
already risen about 21 cm since 1900 and the rate at which it is rising
is accelerating. This is largely due to the decrease in freshwater
impoundment in the face of a significant increase in ice sheet melt and
thermal expansion. Sea-level rise is a major contributor to coastal
flooding around the world, which is one of the main hazards coastal
communities have to face. These communities are particularly exposed to
flooding, and so it is important to understand how to assess their
vulnerability, and develop solutions that improve people's quality of
living and protection. In our house-elevation model, we are implementing
a policy search analysis in order to understand what action should be
taken that will minimize the cost of damages. The elevation that is
being examined is a risk management strategy in the form of
floodproofing. In our analysis we must make a lot of assumptions in
order to quantify the risk associated with flooding in the area of our
home. This estimation of risk is particularly apparent in the definition
of the states of the world (SOWs), or scenarios, over which we inspect
our damages and costs. The components of our SOWs are sea-level rise,
storm surge, and the discount rate, all of which are estimated to a
certain degree due to uncertainty in climate change, future economies,
and physical dynamics among other things. These estimations can lead to
overconfidence in results that are not fully representative of real
world happenings, so while it is impossible to perfectly model each
component, we can implement more in depth analysis of the individual
factors contributing to flooding. To stress the importance of the
representation of the SOW components, if we underestimate the frequency
or intensity of flooding, we will then underestimate the amount of
damages induced, and then the cost of the damages, so in the end, the
analysis of these components is the first step in quantifying risk. In
this project I will focus on the improvement of the modeling of one of
the scenario components, sea-level rise, through the rejection sampling
to produce a sample of parameters that are consistent with expert
predictions of future sea-level rise.

\subsection{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}

Clearly define the problem statement that your chosen feature aims to
address. Explain the significance of this problem in the context of
climate risk management.

\subsection{Selected Feature}\label{selected-feature}

Describe the feature you have selected to add to the existing
decision-support tool. Discuss how this feature relates to the problem
statement and its potential to improve climate risk assessment.

\section{Literature Review}\label{literature-review}

Provide a brief overview of the theoretical background related to your
chosen feature. Cite at least two relevant journal articles to support
your approach (see
\href{https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html}{Quarto
docs} for help with citations). Explain how these articles contribute to
the justification of your selected feature.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}

\subsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}

You should make your modifications in either the \texttt{HouseElevation}
or \texttt{ParkingGarage} module. Detail the steps taken to implement
the selected feature and integrate it into the decision-support tool.
Include code snippets and explanations where necessary to clarify the
implementation process.

\subsection{Validation}\label{validation}

As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to
misleading results. To minimize the risk of errors making their way into
final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.
Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of your implemented feature. Discuss any challenges faced
during the validation process and how they were addressed.

\section{Results}\label{results}

Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.
Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the
outcomes. Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented
feature addresses the problem statement. Use the
\texttt{\#\textbar{}\ output:\ false} and/or
\texttt{\#\textbar{}\ echo:\ false} tags to hide code output and code
cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a
plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the
discussion. You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can
create using \texttt{\#\#}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}

Analyze the implications of your results for climate risk management.
Consider the context of the class themes and discuss how your findings
contribute to the understanding of climate risk assessment. Identify any
limitations of your approach and suggest potential improvements for
future work.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions-1}

Summarize the key findings of your project and reiterate the
significance of your implemented feature in addressing the problem
statement. Discuss the broader implications of your work for climate
risk management and the potential for further research in this area.
