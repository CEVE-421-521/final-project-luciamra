# Introduction

As the climate warms and humans continue to emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, the sea-level will continue to rise at alarming rates. According to the European Environment Agency, the global sea level has already risen about 21 cm since 1900 and the rate at which it is rising is accelerating. This is largely due to the decrease in freshwater impoundment in the face of a significant increase in ice sheet melt and thermal expansion. Sea-level rise is a major contributor to coastal flooding around the world, which is one of the main hazards coastal communities have to face. These communities are particularly exposed to flooding, and so it is important to understand how to assess their vulnerability, and develop solutions that improve peopleâ€™s quality of living and protection.
In our house-elevation model, we are implementing a policy search analysis in order to understand what action should be taken that will minimize the cost of damages. The elevation that is being examined is a risk management strategy in the form of floodproofing. In our analysis we must make a lot of assumptions in order to quantify the risk associated with flooding in the area of our home. This estimation of risk is particularly apparent in the definition of the states of the world (SOWs), or scenarios, over which we inspect our damages and costs. The components of our SOWs are sea-level rise, storm surge, and the discount rate, all of which are estimated to a certain degree due to uncertainty in climate change, future economies, and physical dynamics among other things. These estimations can lead to overconfidence in results that are not fully representative of real world happenings, so while it is impossible to perfectly model each component, we can implement more in depth analysis of the individual factors contributing to flooding. To stress the importance of the representation of the SOW components, if we underestimate the frequency or intensity of flooding, we will then underestimate the amount of damages induced, and then the cost of the damages, so in the end, the analysis of these components is the first step in quantifying risk. In this project I will focus on the improvement of the modeling of one of the scenario components, sea-level rise, through the rejection sampling to produce a sample of parameters that are consistent with expert predictions of future sea-level rise.


## Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem statement that your chosen feature aims to address.
Explain the significance of this problem in the context of climate risk management.

## Selected Feature

Describe the feature you have selected to add to the existing decision-support tool.
Discuss how this feature relates to the problem statement and its potential to improve climate risk assessment.

# Literature Review

Provide a brief overview of the theoretical background related to your chosen feature.
Cite at least two relevant journal articles to support your approach (see [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html) for help with citations).
Explain how these articles contribute to the justification of your selected feature.

# Methodology

## Implementation

You should make your modifications in either the `HouseElevation` or `ParkingGarage` module.
Detail the steps taken to implement the selected feature and integrate it into the decision-support tool.
Include code snippets and explanations where necessary to clarify the implementation process.

## Validation

As we have seen in labs, mistakes are inevitable and can lead to misleading results.
To minimize the risk of errors making their way into final results, it is essential to validate the implemented feature.
Describe the validation techniques used to ensure the accuracy and reliability of your implemented feature.
Discuss any challenges faced during the validation process and how they were addressed.

# Results

Present the results obtained from the enhanced decision-support tool.
Use tables, figures, and visualizations to clearly communicate the outcomes.
Provide sufficient detail to demonstrate how the implemented feature addresses the problem statement.
Use the `#| output: false` and/or `#| echo: false` tags to hide code output and code cells in the final report except where showing the output (e.g.g, a plot) or the code (e.g., how you are sampling SOWs) adds value to the discussion.
You may have multiple subsections of results, which you can create using `##`.

# Conclusions

## Discussion

Analyze the implications of your results for climate risk management.
Consider the context of the class themes and discuss how your findings contribute to the understanding of climate risk assessment.
Identify any limitations of your approach and suggest potential improvements for future work.

## Conclusions

Summarize the key findings of your project and reiterate the significance of your implemented feature in addressing the problem statement.
Discuss the broader implications of your work for climate risk management and the potential for further research in this area.
